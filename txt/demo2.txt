HALFEN - Flachanker Typ FA    Calculation based:  - DIBt Zul.Nr. Z-21.8-1979
The dimensioning was made of the pins to DIBt Zul. Z-21.8-1926. FA and MVA anchors to DIBt Zul. Z21.8-19
The printed report was produced with version  4.31.0.0+
Position was calculated with version: 4.31.0.0

All data, in particular the static values are for the HALFEN Sandwich panel anchors system.
Load capacities for apparently identical non HALFEN products can deviate significantly;
this can lead to load failure and therefore to damage.
HALFEN GmbH is not liable for damage caused when using third-party products.

Explanatory and calculation notes:

● Following documents have to be observed: All Technical Information included in the General
certificate of DIBt approval and current valid type testing for anchoring systems.
Additionally, all relevant dimensions and units for building construction have to be observed.

● The wind loads must be checked by the responsible engineer.

● The embedment depth of all internal components has to be verified!
Only the minimum embedment depths are considered, in the calculation.
● The concrete grade of the facing layer is outside the approval

● Overhangs existing:  For overhanging areas, wind pressure and wind suction will not be calculated
simultaneously. Refer to Help.

● Thickness of facing:  6 cm  does not correspond to the default in the type design examination

● Requirement: Concrete qualtity min. C30/37
